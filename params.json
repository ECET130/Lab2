You may right click its launch icon and make a shortcut to your desktop if you wish.\r\nLaunch the Arduino IDE by double clicking its icon. \r\n\r\nLoad last weeks Lab1 - Part3 code and verify it still compiles and loads on your arduino. \r\n\r\n#Part2:\r\nModify last weeks Lab1 â€“ Part3  circuit to add a pushbutton to Digital pin 2. Your breadboard should now have 3 LEDs connected to your Uno on digital pins 7, 6, and 5  and a switch connected to digital pin 2.  Make sure you use 220 ohm current limiting resistors for the LEDs and a 10k resistor for the pushbutton.\r\n\r\n",
